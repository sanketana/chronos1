### *1. Date & Timing Issues*

* *Monday default bug*: When choosing Monday, the system sets the date to the day before. Needs fixing. --> done
* *Meeting times off (4AM/5AM bug)*: Scheduler results sometimes show early morning times that were not chosen (e.g., 9‚Äì2 showing up as 4AM slots). --> done
--> done
* *Time mismatch*: Faculty vs. student views show different times for the same event. Needs consistency. --> done 

---

### *2. Labels & Terminology*

* The term *‚ÄúSecondary group‚Äù* (students) may not work since it could also include *faculty, guest speakers, or staff*. She asked for a more inclusive label (suggestions: ‚Äúattendees‚Äù).
* Needs *clearer definitions of status labels* (‚ÄúCollecting availability,‚Äù ‚ÄúScheduling,‚Äù ‚ÄúPublished‚Äù)‚Äîwhat they mean, when schedules lock, whether edits are allowed, and if participants get notified. --> done

---

### *3. Permissions & Visibility*

* Faculty should *only see events they are assigned to*, not all events (e.g., avoid confusion like seeing ‚Äúbarbecue‚Äù events unrelated to them).
* Asked about whether faculty-side privacy/security controls could be improved.

[Update] This needs further discussion, as in the current application we are NOT assigning the events to a faculty anywhere
Do you need additional option for assign an event to the faculty
Also, the same requirement would be applicable for Students too
So how do we define that what events are visible to the Students and the professor. 
This can be implemented, but first we need a clear rule for esablishign the relationship between Faculty/Student <-> Event.
Parking this requirement for now.

### *4. Scheduling Behavior*

* Clarify if the scheduler can be *run multiple times* for the same event, and what happens when availability/status changes.
* Define whether schedules ‚Äúlock‚Äù after publishing or if admins can revert to ‚Äúcollecting availability.‚Äù

- Yes scheduler can be run multiple times
- Schedule for an event (meetings) are visible to faculty and attendee only after it is in published state
- Only schedule generated by the most recent version of Scheduler run is visible to the faculty / attendee
- Ideally, the availability and status should NOT change after "collecting availability" moves to "scheduling" and at that point the avaiability gets locked (No longer visible for editing to faculty / student) 
- AFTER Scheduler run - For MINOR changes - The meetings can be edited / added directly (for eg: 5-10 meetings max)
- AFTER Scheduler run - For MAJOR changes - The scheduler can be rerun, BUT it might alter the previously generated meetings, so use with caution if the meetings have already been published. As the audience might see a differnt schedule
- Admin can also move from "Published" --> "Collecting Availability" is they wish to do major availability update and rerun the scheduler.

### *5. Notifications*

* Asked if *participants automatically receive notifications* when schedules are published, or if admins must manually email them.

[Added Pre-Drafted Email]
implemented a Meeting Invitations feature that addresses the notification requirement. The feature adds a "üìß Meeting Invitations" button next to the "Export as Excel" button on the Meetings tab. When clicked, it opens a modal where admins can select any published event from a dropdown, and the system automatically generates two Outlook-ready email drafts: one for faculty (grouped by professor with their meeting schedules) and one for attendees (individual meeting details). The emails are formatted for direct copy-paste into Outlook with proper subject lines, recipient lists, and Central Time notation. This provides a streamlined solution where admins can easily generate professional meeting notifications without requiring complex email server integration - they simply copy the generated content, paste it into their university Outlook account, and send to all participants with zero manual editing required.


---

### *6. Student Preferences*

* Currently, students must enter *multiple preferences (2‚Äì5)*.
* She suggested making *Preference 2‚Äì4 optional*, since not all events require multiple choices.
* Ideally, this should be *configurable per event by admins* (some events may need all five, others only one).

---

### *7. General Feedback*

* She and her colleague found the tool *impressive, simple, and useful, but emphasized the need for **clarity and definitions* to avoid confusion for staff and faculty.

---

‚úÖ *Your action items*:

* Fix *date/time bugs*.
* Update *terminology & status definitions*.
* Restrict *faculty event visibility*.
