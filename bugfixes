### *1. Date & Timing Issues*

* *Monday default bug*: When choosing Monday, the system sets the date to the day before. Needs fixing. --> done
* *Meeting times off (4AM/5AM bug)*: Scheduler results sometimes show early morning times that were not chosen (e.g., 9–2 showing up as 4AM slots). --> done
* *Time mismatch*: Faculty vs. student views show different times for the same event. Needs consistency. --> done 

---

### *2. Labels & Terminology*

* The term *“Secondary group”* (students) may not work since it could also include *faculty, guest speakers, or staff*. She asked for a more inclusive label (suggestions: “attendees”).
* Needs *clearer definitions of status labels* (“Collecting availability,” “Scheduling,” “Published”)—what they mean, when schedules lock, whether edits are allowed, and if participants get notified.

---

### *3. Permissions & Visibility*

* Faculty should *only see events they are assigned to*, not all events (e.g., avoid confusion like seeing “barbecue” events unrelated to them).
* Asked about whether faculty-side privacy/security controls could be improved.

---

### *4. Scheduling Behavior*

* Clarify if the scheduler can be *run multiple times* for the same event, and what happens when availability/status changes.
* Define whether schedules “lock” after publishing or if admins can revert to “collecting availability.”

---

### *5. Notifications*

* Asked if *participants automatically receive notifications* when schedules are published, or if admins must manually email them.

---

### *6. Student Preferences*

* Currently, students must enter *multiple preferences (2–5)*.
* She suggested making *Preference 2–4 optional*, since not all events require multiple choices.
* Ideally, this should be *configurable per event by admins* (some events may need all five, others only one).

---

### *7. General Feedback*

* She and her colleague found the tool *impressive, simple, and useful, but emphasized the need for **clarity and definitions* to avoid confusion for staff and faculty.
